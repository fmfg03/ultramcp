   - Intelligent eviction policies

6. **Project Scanner** (`core/project_scanner.py`)
   - Intelligent project analysis
   - File filtering and categorization
   - Language detection and statistics

## Service Integration

### Docker Orchestration

The Claude Code Memory service is fully integrated into the UltraMCP docker-compose stack:

```yaml
ultramcp-claude-memory:
  build:
    context: ./services/claude-code-memory
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  ports:
    - "8009:8009"
  depends_on:
    - ultramcp-qdrant
  environment:
    - QDRANT_URL=http://ultramcp-qdrant:6333
```

### API Gateway Integration

The service is proxied through the unified API gateway at `/api/memory/*` endpoints.

### Database Integration

The Qdrant vector database is deployed as a separate service for optimal performance and scalability.

## Makefile Commands

The following commands are available for Claude Code Memory operations:

### Project Management
- `make memory-index PROJECT='path' NAME='name'` - Index project
- `make memory-projects` - List indexed projects  
- `make memory-status` - Check service status

### Code Analysis
- `make memory-search QUERY='...' PROJECT='...'` - Semantic search
- `make memory-analyze FILE='...' PROJECT='...'` - Pattern analysis
- `make memory-find-similar PATTERN='...' PROJECT='...'` - Find similar code

### Enhanced Workflows
- `make memory-learn-codebase` - Index UltraMCP codebase
- `make memory-debate TOPIC='...' PROJECT='...'` - Memory-enhanced debates
- `make memory-quality-check FILE='...' PROJECT='...'` - Quality assessment
- `make memory-explore` - Interactive exploration

### Testing & Maintenance
- `make test-memory-integration` - Integration tests
- `make memory-clean` - Clear memory (destructive)

## Integration with Existing Services

### Chain-of-Debate Protocol
Memory-enhanced debates provide intelligent code context injection, enabling more informed architectural discussions.

### Blockoli Code Intelligence
Complementary code analysis capabilities with different focus areas and indexing strategies.

### Control Tower Orchestration
Centralized coordination of memory operations with other microservices.

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- Parse results cached with file checksums
- Vector embeddings cached for content hashes
- Multi-tier memory and disk caching

### Batch Processing
- Efficient batch indexing with configurable batch sizes
- Parallel processing for multiple projects
- Background maintenance tasks

### Resource Management
- Configurable memory limits
- Intelligent cache eviction
- Connection pooling for database operations

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333
MEMORY_SERVICE_PORT=8009
SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_HOME=/app/models
TREE_SITTER_PARSERS_PATH=/app/tree_sitter_parsers
```

### Service Configuration
The service supports extensive configuration for:
- Supported file extensions
- Ignore patterns
- Cache limits and TTL
- Vector database settings
- Model selection

## Usage Examples

### Basic Code Search
```bash
make memory-search QUERY="authentication middleware" PROJECT="webapp"
```

### Pattern Analysis
```bash
make memory-analyze FILE="src/auth/middleware.py" PROJECT="webapp"
```

### Memory-Enhanced Debate
```bash
make memory-debate TOPIC="Refactor authentication system" PROJECT="webapp"
```

### Quality Assessment
```bash
make memory-quality-check FILE="src/main.py" PROJECT="webapp"
```

## Integration Status

# Check Qdrant service status
make memory-status
docker logs ultramcp-qdrant
```

**Indexing Performance**
```bash
# Monitor indexing progress
tail -f logs/combined.log | grep "memory"
```

**Memory Usage**
```bash
# Check memory service stats
curl http://localhost:8009/memory/stats
```
