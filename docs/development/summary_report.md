# Project Merge Summary Report

**Date**: May 09, 2025

**Objective**: Merge the legacy project (Phases 1-4, from `mcp-broker_scheduler_enhanced.zip`) with the then-current project state (Phases 5-8, from `/home/ubuntu/project_audit_temp/`) into a new consolidated project located at `/home/ubuntu/project/`. The primary goal was to restore missing components from early development phases while preserving all new developments from later phases, and specifically using the legacy versions of `mcpBrokerService.js`, `orchestrationService.js`, and the entire `frontend` directory.

**Merge Process Overview**:

1.  **Legacy Project Extraction**: The `mcp-broker_scheduler_enhanced.zip` was extracted to `/tmp/mcp-legacy/`.
2.  **Baseline**: The most recent project state (Phases 5-8, previously in `/home/ubuntu/project_audit_temp/`) was copied to the new target directory `/home/ubuntu/project/`.
3.  **Overlaying Legacy Files**: Non-conflicting files from `/tmp/mcp-legacy/` were copied into `/home/ubuntu/project/` using `cp -nR` (to avoid overwriting newer files unless specified).
4.  **Specific Overwrites (as per instructions)**:
    *   `mcpBrokerService.js`: The version from `/tmp/mcp-legacy/backend/src/services/` was copied to `/home/ubuntu/project/backend/src/services/`.
    *   `orchestrationService.js`: The version from `/tmp/mcp-legacy/backend/src/services/` was copied to `/home/ubuntu/project/backend/src/services/`.
    *   `frontend/`: The entire `/tmp/mcp-legacy/frontend/` directory was copied to `/home/ubuntu/project/`, replacing the existing frontend content.

**Verification of Merged State**:

The merged project in `/home/ubuntu/project/` now contains:

*   **Newer Adapters (Phases 5-8)**: `ClaudeToolAgentAdapter.js`, `ClaudeWebSearchAdapter.js`, `EmbeddingSearchAdapter.js`, `TelegramAdapter.js`.
*   **Legacy Adapters (Phases 1-4, confirmed present)**: `baseMCPAdapter.js`, `chromaAdapter.js`, `cliAdapter.js`, `emailAdapter.js`, `firecrawlAdapter.js`, `getzepAdapter.js`, `githubAdapter.js`, `jupyterAdapter.js`, `notionAdapter.js`, `pythonAdapter.js`, `schedulerAdapter.js`, `stagehandAdapter.js`.
*   **Newer Services (Phases 5-8)**: `InputPreprocessorService.js`, `modelRouterService.js`, `logService.cjs`.
*   **Core Services (from Legacy)**: `mcpBrokerService.js`, `orchestrationService.js`.
*   **Frontend**: The complete frontend from the legacy `mcp-broker_scheduler_enhanced.zip`.

**Key Outcomes & Current Status**:

*   The project now reflects a more complete history, incorporating components from all development phases (1 through 8).
*   The `InputPreprocessorService` and `ModelRouterService` (from recent phases) are present.
*   The `orchestrationService` and `mcpBrokerService` are the versions from the legacy zip, as requested. This means that the `ModelRouterService` is still **not integrated** into the `orchestrationService` flow, as the legacy `orchestrationService` would not have this integration.
*   The frontend is the version from the legacy zip.

**Next Steps (Recommendations)**:

1.  **Thorough Testing**: The merged application requires comprehensive testing to ensure all components (legacy and new) function correctly together, especially given the mix-and-match of core services and adapters.
2.  **Integrate `ModelRouterService`**: A key task for the next phase will be to integrate the `ModelRouterService` with the (now legacy) `orchestrationService.js` to enable dynamic LLM selection.
3.  **Review `credentialsService.js`**: Ensure the `credentialsService.js` (from `/home/ubuntu/project/src/services/`) is compatible with all adapters, both new and legacy, particularly how it's imported and used (ESM vs CommonJS considerations if they arise).
4.  **Update `audit_report.md`**: The previous audit report needs to be revisited and updated based on this newly merged codebase, especially concerning the `orchestrationService` and `frontend` sections.

This merge aims to provide a solid foundation for future development by consolidating all existing work.
