# Scenario-CoD Integration Architecture

## Overview
Integration of the Scenario testing framework with UltraMCP Chain-of-Debate Protocol to provide comprehensive conversation quality assurance and debate testing capabilities.

## Core Components

### 1. CoD Agent Adapter
- Wraps existing CoD agents for Scenario framework
- Handles debate context extraction and state management
- Manages multi-agent debate coordination

### 2. Enhanced Judge System
- Multi-perspective evaluation with domain-specific judges
- Argument quality assessment and logical consistency checking
- Real-time debate progress monitoring

### 3. Debate-Specific Validators
- Structured argument validation
- Evidence citation checking
- Logical fallacy detection
- Consensus building measurement

### 4. Testing Suite
- Unit tests for individual agent responses
- Integration tests for multi-agent debates
- End-to-end tests for complete debate cycles
- Edge case handling (fallacies, bad faith arguments)

## Integration Points

### UltraMCP CoD Service (Port 8001)
- Enhanced with Scenario testing endpoints
- Real-time evaluation during debates
- Quality metrics collection

### Local Models Integration
- Test local vs cloud model debate quality
- Performance comparison across different models
- Offline testing capabilities

### Event System
- Real-time debate monitoring
- Quality metrics tracking
- Automated intervention triggers

## Testing Strategies

### Argument Quality
- Logical structure validation
- Evidence quality assessment
- Citation accuracy checking

### Debate Flow
- Turn-taking adherence
- Response relevance measurement
- Consensus progression tracking

### Error Handling
- Fallacy resistance testing
- Contradiction detection
- Recovery mechanism validation

## Configuration
- Debate-specific scenario templates
- Quality threshold definitions
- Model-specific testing configurations
- Real-time intervention rules
